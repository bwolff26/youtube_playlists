# youtube_playlists

I like music and I love free platforms to listen to them. So, given the fact that I'm already on Youtube for whatever other videos, I like to remain local and use their music services. Unfortunately, among other things to complain about (~ March 2024), videos in my ever growing playlist are frequently removed - without even leaving me the courtesy of telling me their name before they skidaddle. So, let's at least minimize the lost by writing some code to track the names of whatever is currently in my playlist. <br>

Afterwards, I'd like to figure out some data-science related project behind songs in my playlist. However, that'd be based upon the assumption that I can get various information about their beat and the like. Furthermore, for that to really be useful, at least in the vision I currently have, I'd want a massive list of songs to parse through the model to make predictions on songs I'm want to like.
    
## Code

I'm naturally inclined to not use any APIs, regardless of how good they might be. So, I won't.
